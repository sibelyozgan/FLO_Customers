## Project Intro/Objective


FLO is a famous shoes retail brand.

The company wanted to group their customers based on their consumption behaviour,in order to discuss/create new marketing strategies.

This project uses CRM (Customer Relationship Management) analytics - RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) metrics in particular, 
unsupervised machine learning techniques and Spark to do a segmentation of FLO customers.

The consumption behaviours of individuals are defined and clusters / customer groups are formed with these techniques.

The purpose of this project is to compare the results of these different techniques.
